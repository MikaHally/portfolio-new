            Digital Product School is a full-time training program by UnternehmerTUM in Munich, Europe's biggest
            Entrepreneurship Center. The program addresses to students with very good academic achievements and strong
            intercultural skills. Every semester approximately 4 CODE Students are able to represent Facebook at this
            three-month long program in Munich as a student talent. All students go through a rigorous selection process
            consisting of a written application and a personal interview. I was fortunate enough to get selected as one
            of those students and joined a “Company Team“ working together with representatives from Deutsche Telekom
            and Stadtwerke Munich (SWM). In addition I received the Digital Talent Scholarship from the Free State of
            Bavaria and a housing scholarship from Facebook.

            I worked in a diverse and cross-functional team to solve problems around the context of mobility and
            transportation. My team built a drive-by solution to capture environmental data in urban areas, such as
            particulate matter, temperature and humidity by using existing infrastructure like for example public buses.
            I was responsible for determining customer needs and desires by conducting customer and market research.
            Beyond that I led our team, consisting of three software engineers and one UX / UI designer, and defined
            product requirements.
            <br>
            Since people from all over the world come to Munich to participate in this program I was required to
            interact with people from different cultural backgrounds, experiences and beliefs. I found working with such
            a diverse workforce to be an enriching learning experience and that made me a more well-rounded product
            manager as a result. I discovered that a diverse workforce looks at things from a different perspective and tends
            to come up with more innovative and out-of-the-box ideas because of the differences that everyone brings to
            the table. However, I also experienced that diversity brings a lot of challenges and threads with it. People
            can feel confused, threatened or annoyed by people with different views, working ethics and backgrounds.
            This can quickly lead to ego battles and power struggles, both of which I experienced myself during my time
            at the Digital Product School. I nevertheless found that with a bit of understanding, empathy and genuine
            interest in other’s thoughts and ideas, problems can be tackled and challenges can be overcome.
            <br>
            At the end of the program we presented and showcased our finished prototype in front of a large audience of
            executives of all company partners. I personally think that this program was a great learning experience
            that made me a better product manager going forward. Moreover I was able to make good friends that I am
            still in contact with.
