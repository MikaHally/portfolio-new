            Little has changed in how researchers recruit respondents for user and market research studies during the
            last decades. Many researchers still rely on traditional agencies to source respondents and have them
            scheduled for interviews, diary studies and focus groups. There is no transparency in how respondents have
            been verified, and the coordination needed to organize a successful study is cumbersome. The combination of
            these factors leads to poor quality respondents and makes research expensive to conduct. These traditional
            methods are no longer appropriate in times when customer-centricity is becoming increasingly more important.
            As customer expectations are constantly growing businesses are more dependent on insights and data around
            their customers’ needs, preferences and decision factors than ever before. Therefore our mission is to give
            all businesses access to high quality respondents so that anyone can conduct user and market research. Since
            launching Keeet, we have helped companies like Porsche, Dentsu Aegis Network and JustWatch to drive their
            product, trajectory and ultimately profitability to give them a competitive edge. With our self-service UX
            research platform new insights are always only one click away!

            The idea for Keeet was born during our studies at CODE University of Applied Sciences. Me and my two
            co-founders originally wanted to develop a voice assistant for the system gastronomy that allowed its guests
            to order drinks and food directly at the table without having to wait for a waiter. After two month of work,
            the first reality check at the restaurant revealed that the voice assistant was completely useless because
            the background noise was much too loud. If we had done tests in a real life environment at an earlier stage,
            we would have saved ourselves a lot of work. We learned from our mistakes and as a result we became very
            involved in the topic of user research and asked ourselves how we could mitigate as much risk as possible
            when starting a new business. After interviewing dozens of UX researchers and product managers we quickly
            realized that they were also struggling with that topic. And so one thing led to another.
            <br>
            A couple of month into this project our startup won the award for “Best student-run startup“ from Business
            Insider Germany and First Momentum Ventures. After talking to some investors we decided to take Keeet to the
            next level and therefore out of university. Soon after we received venture capital from APX (Axel Springer &
            Porsche).

            Beyond that we were fortunate enough to get accepted into the Jump-Start program of the German Accelerator.
            The program is an intensive, one-month resident program designed specifically to introduce high-potential
            early-stage German startups to the Silicon Valley ecosystem and its best practices. As part of the program
            we spent one month in the Bay Area and received guidance from renowned mentors that helped us to make
            critical early decisions about product, market and business models which fundamentally improved our growth
            trajectory to become a global player in the future.
